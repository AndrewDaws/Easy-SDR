# How to export Gerber file from EasyEDA

## Why should I export these files?
The answer is simple - if you want to order production of PCBs on a platform other than [JLCPCB], you need to export the files (Gerber) necessary for the production of your printed circuit board. After exporting the files, you will need to upload the received files to the PCB manufacturing service.  

You can find ready Gerber files for a specific module in the directory:  
**Easy-SDR repository / Module name / Component group / Gerbers**.

## Exporting Gerber files
First, go to the page of the module you are interested in on the EasyEDA website.  
![Module page](../Resources/EasyEDA%20Gerber%20export/EasyEDA-1-Module-page.png)  

Select the Documents section and move down to the PCBs block. **If you do not want to edit the PCB before exporting the Gerber file, then you can immediately press the "Download Gerber" button or "Order at JLCPCB" (in that case you will be redirected to [JLCPCB] service)**. After that, the Gerber file will be automatically downloaded. In the case, if you need to make an adjustment to an existing revision of the board - click the "Open in Editor" button.  
![Open editor](../Resources/EasyEDA%20Gerber%20export/EasyEDA-2-Open-editor.png)  

Click "Open in Editor" button, whereby you will be taken to the EasyEDA editor where you can pre-edit the layout of the PCB before exporting.

After all the necessary corrections we can make exporting the Gerber file. To do this, you need to on the right, in the top panel of the editor, click the "Generate Gerber" button.  
![Gerber export](../Resources/EasyEDA%20Gerber%20export/EasyEDA-4-Gerber-export.png)  

Next, small window appearing where you can see a small image of your PCB and some information needed for placing an order on the JLCPCB (manufacturing parameters, quantity, shipping information, and price). At this step, you can either just **save the Gerber file, by pushing "Generate Gerber" button**, preview the Gerber file with "Gerber View", or going to the JLCPCB platform to ordering the PCB.

Gerber View page:

Redirecting to JLCPCB:  
![JLCPCB redirect](../Resources/EasyEDA%20Gerber%20export/EasyEDA-7-JLCPCB-redirect.png)  

If you choose redirection to JLCPCB, the Gerber file will be automatically downloaded to JLCPCB checked for trace errors, the price and time of production are calculated. After that, you can pay for the formed order.
